Here, we will clean and process a small database into a temporal network of patient transfers.

All the functionality is provided in the `hospinet` library.
```{python}
import hospinet

import polars as pl
import networkx as nx

from pprint import pprint
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt # for later
```


We load the database (in the form of a csv), and clean it using the `hospinet.cleaner` submodule. We specify the column names, since they are different from the (standardised) default.
```{python}
source_db = hospinet.cleaner.ingest_csv("./data/admissions.csv", convert_dates=True)
source_db.head(5)
```

```{python}
cleaned_db = hospinet.cleaner.clean_database(
    source_db,
    delete_missing="record",
    delete_errors="record",
    subject_id = 'patient',
    facility_id = 'hospital',
    admission_date = 'admission',
    discharge_date = 'discharge',
    retain_auxiliary_data = True,
)
# encode dates to numerics
first_date = cleaned_db.select(pl.col('Adate').min()).item()
numeric_db = hospinet.cleaner.normalise_dates(
    cleaned_db,
    cols = ['Adate', 'Ddate'],
    ref_date = first_date
) 
```

We can then process this into a TemporalNetwork object directly using the `from_presence` class method

```{python}
network = hospinet.TemporalNetwork.from_presence(
    numeric_db,
    discretisation=1,
)
```

This object is also a `networkx.DiGraph` object, so we can use the native plotting functionality. We project this down to static nodes first, so that we don't get the full temporal graph.

```{python}
static_network = network.to_static()
pos = nx.spring_layout(static_network, seed=1451)
edge_labels = {
        tuple(edge): f"{attr}"
        for *edge, attr in static_network.edges(data='weight')
    }
nx.draw_networkx(static_network, pos=pos, connectionstyle='arc3,rad=0.05')
nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(
    static_network, 
    pos=pos, 
    edge_labels=edge_labels,
    label_pos=0.4,
    connectionstyle='arc3,rad=0.05'
);
```

We provide some basic indexing support via methods:

```{python}
print("Hospitals with presence at time 15: ", network.locs_at_time(15))
print("Corresponding nodes: ", network.nodes_at_time(15))
print("When hospital D is occupied: ")
pprint(network.times_for_place('D'), width=70, compact=True)
```
